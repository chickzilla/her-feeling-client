        You find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, deserted field as the
        sun begins to set, casting long, melancholic shadows across the land.
        The air is thick with the scent of rain, though none has fallen yet. In
        the distance, the faint outline of a dilapidated farmhouse stands as a
        solitary sentinel, a reminder of better days long past. The once-vibrant
        crops that used to dance in the breeze now lay withered and forgotten, a
        testament to the passage of time and neglect.
